# Port-Hunter
Certainly! Here's an example of a README.md file for the port scanner code, including details on how to run the commands:

# Port Scanner

This is a simple Python script for scanning open ports on a given target. It utilizes socket programming and multi-threading to efficiently scan a range of ports on the target.

## Usage

# Clone the repository:


   git clone https://github.com/your-username/port-scanner.git


# Navigate to the project directory:


   cd port-scanner

# Run the port scanner:

   python port_scanner.py -t <target> -pf <start_port> -pl <end_port>
  

   Replace `<target>` with the IP address or domain name of the target to scan.

   Optionally, specify the starting and ending ports to scan. If not provided, the scanner will scan ports 0 to 65535.

   Example:

   python port_scanner.py -t 127.0.0.1 -pf 1 -pl 1000
  
# View the results:

   The script will display the open ports on the target, along with the service name and version (if available). Additionally, it will show the execution time and the percentage of ports scanned.

   Example output:

  
   Open ports on 127.0.0.1:
   Port 80: HTTP (Apache/2.4.29)
   Port 443: HTTPS (OpenSSL/1.1.1)

   Scanned 1000 ports out of 1000 total ports.
   Percentage scanned: 100.00%
   Execution time: 2.56 seconds
